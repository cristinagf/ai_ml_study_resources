# Deep Learning with PyTorch
The goal of this modules is to get some hands on experience and understanding the basics of Deep Learning with PyTorch.

These modules provide a set of notebooks that will help you explore deep learning concepts.

## Pre-requisites

Before following these modules, a basic understanding of Neural Networks is required.


## Modules

1. Logistic regression and loss functions
2. Softmax Regression
3. Shallow Neural Networks
4. Deep Neural Networks
5. Convolutional Neural Networks
- Application: Anomaly detection
- Application: Recommendation
- Feature selection

### Note
The organization of this repo and the exercises included in the modules are based on Coursera programs.
